- Cleanup architecture
    - create.py and export.py aren't the best names
    - Maybe make these the function names in a single module and have a single
      script handle both?
- Add real argument parsing to create.py
- Add real help information to create.py
- Add ability to get all posts
- Add ability to get post by id
- Add ability to get post by slug
- Add option to give credentials via command line and automatically save for
  later
